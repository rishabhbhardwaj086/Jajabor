        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          We’re <strong>Hardik Das</strong> and <strong>Rishabh Bhardwaj</strong> — two travellers, storytellers, and friends who believe journeys are meant to be felt, not just seen.  
          <br><br>
          “Jajabor” isn’t just a travel brand — it’s an emotion for everyone who loves wandering without boundaries. We’ve faced the challenges every explorer does: unreliable info, missed local gems, and disconnected experiences. That’s what inspired us to create something that makes travelling smarter, more personal, and truly connected to the soul of India.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To make travel more human. We want to connect travellers with local culture, real experiences, and meaningful journeys — blending modern tools with heartfelt stories.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>🌍 Focus on offbeat, local, and eco-friendly destinations</li>
          <li>🤝 Traveller-to-Traveller sharing and verified experiences</li>
          <li>📍 Smart discovery tools and community insights</li>
          <li>💬 Real human connection, not just ratings</li>

  <!-- Behind the Name -->
  <section class="about-name unified-section-light">
    <h2>Behind The Name “Jajabor”</h2>
    <p>
      “Jajabor” — an Assamese word meaning <em>wanderer</em> — reflects our belief that travelling isn’t about destinations, it’s about the journey itself.  
      <br><br>
      Every Indian traveller carries a spark of Jajabor within them — curious, open-hearted, and eager to connect with people and stories across the country. This spirit is what drives everything we do.
